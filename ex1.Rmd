```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Download contacts data from LinkedIn


```{r }
library(readr)
Connections <- read_csv(file="exercices/Connections.csv")
View(Connections)

```

## Get the count of contacts + Create nodes and edges dataframes

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

df = Connections %>% group_by(Company) %>% count(Company) %>% arrange(-n)

df
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
